# Birthday Present web application

This is a simple web application created to reveal a birthday present. In this project I have utilized Gemini API. 
The API is used for a simple "chat bot" which knows the correct answer and guides the user with hints if a wrong answer is entered.
Deployed with Vercel. Online right now at: izasfodelsedag.se
